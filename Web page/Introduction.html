    Unlike the volatility of traditional market assets, the volatility of crypto currency markets is very high, and albeit they share the characteristics of traditional stock markets, they are highly unstable. Indeed these markets are decentralized and unregulated, and also subject to manipulation.</p>

    Nowadays many are the entrepreneurs who invest in block-chain, the well-known technology underlying the most popular crypto currencies including Bitcoin, and we can expect that this number will grow as the Bitcoin utility increases; and many are the people who speculate on the bitcoin price.</p>

    Speculating on the Bitcoin market may offer the opportunity to obtain substantial returns, but it may also entail a very high risk. So to judge the best time to enter the market is extremely important in order to get profits and not to lose too much money.</p>
<p style="font-family:Monospace; text-align:center; font-size:160%;">
    The price of Bitcoin changes every day, just like the price of fiat currencies. However the Bitcoin price changes are on a greater scale than that of the fiat currency changes. As a result to get an idea of the future price trend can be extremely important. To date, several on-line platforms make available several technical analysis tools that allow the bitcoin speculators to identify trends and market sentiment; the number of the research papers that investigate the future bitcoin price trend is increasing.
